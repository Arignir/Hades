## Download

Hades is still under heavy development, but you can download the latest nightly build for your favorite operating system [here](https://nightly.link/Arignir/Hades/workflows/main/master).

## Run

You need a game ROM and a legitimate GameBoy Advance BIOS or a [replacement BIOS](https://github.com/Cult-of-GBA/BIOS/blob/master/bios.bin).

Sart Hades, then click on `File` -> `Open BIOS` and select the BIOS you downloaded above.

You can now play all your favorite games! Click on `File` -> `Open` and select the ROM you want to run.

Alternatively, you can also drag and drop your GBA rom over `hades.exe` (Windows only).

## Build

The build dependencies are:

  - `meson`
  - `ninja`
  - `GCC`
  - `SDL2` and `SDL2_Image`
  - `OpenGL`
  - `glew`

On Ubuntu, you can install all those dependencies with:

```bash
$ apt install meson ninja-build gcc libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libglew-dev
```

To build Hades, run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
meson build
cd build
ninja
```
